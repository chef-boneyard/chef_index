# There is no easy way to filter out warnings for uncooperative
# modules. Here we provide an ugly hack that allows us to regularly
# run Dialyzer and ignore the warnings that come from neotoma
# generated code. We run dialyzer against the ebin_dialyzer directory
# which is created anew for each run and has the problem modules
# (those generated by neotoma) removed.
